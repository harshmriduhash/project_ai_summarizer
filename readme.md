## Introduction
In 2023, we now have the power to build robust AI software startups! I Made an Article Summarizer Application using OpenAI's GPT model.
 
Alongside building this application, here are few features:- 
- setup a ReactJS project using Vite
- created a responsive, beautiful UI/UX with a nice touch of glass morphism using Tailwind CSS
- made advanced RTK query API requests that fire on condition
- save history using the local storage
- handle form events and catch errors
- implement copy to clipboard
- clean code
